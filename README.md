# Group 24 - CPSC 304 Restaurant Database Project
<h2>Notes for Julian &#128515;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although the actual Michelin website lists 76 Michelin restaurants in Vancouver, our database contains sample data of a handful of restaurants that have been carefully selected to sufficiently demonstrate the functionality of our queries.</li>
  <li>For the purposes of testing and demoing, AverageScore in our Restaurant table's sample data was based off google reviews rather than our own reviews</li>
</ul>
